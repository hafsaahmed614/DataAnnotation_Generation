As the facility aggressively pushes for discharge to avoid the 100-day Medicare cliff, a Managed Medicare authorization denial and the sudden illness of the only local Pulmonologist create a high-risk transition gap. The PN must navigate institutional gatekeeping and provider shortages to ensure the patient has life-sustaining oxygen at home before the facility executes a 'Friday Dump' discharge."
