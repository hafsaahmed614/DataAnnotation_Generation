The facility's burned-out Social Worker is aggressively steering the family toward a permanent Long-Term Care (LTC) bed to protect the facility's financial interest as the '100-Day Cliff' approaches. Because PT has declared a 'Loss of Skilled Need,' the PN must navigate the administrative hurdle of establishing 'Skilled Nursing' as the primary eligibility trigger to ensure a successful transition to home-based wound care."
