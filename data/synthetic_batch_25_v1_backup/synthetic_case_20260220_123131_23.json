The PN had to overcome a 14-day 'Black Hole' delay in assignment to build enough trust with the family to prevent facility-led steering. By coordinating a specialized HHA bridge, the PN mitigated the 5-day care gap caused by the provider's illness, ensuring the patient didn't bounce back to the hospital for a wound infection or CHF flare-up."
