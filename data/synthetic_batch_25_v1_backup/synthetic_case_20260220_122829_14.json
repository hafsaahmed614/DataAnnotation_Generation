The institutional friction is high, with a burned-out Social Worker causing a 'Black Hole' delay and a PT department that has prematurely plateaued the patient to facilitate bed turnover. The PN must navigate a hostile son's distrust while strategically coordinating with the Wound NP to justify a 'Skilled Nursing' need to prevent a total loss of home care eligibility."
