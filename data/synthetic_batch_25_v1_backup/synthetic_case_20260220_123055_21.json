  "narrative_summary": "Arthur, a 77-year-old recovering from spinal fusion, is caught in a political crossfire between a burned-out Social Worker and a facility eager to discharge him before his Day 20 Medicare co-pay begins. The situation is complicated by the sudden shingles diagnosis of the region's only mobile wound specialist, creating a dangerous care gap for his surgical incision. The PN must navigate the 'Black Hole' of a delayed referral while bypassing administrative bottlenecks to secure Managed Medicare authorization. Success hinges on bridging the clinical gap with the HHA team while managing a family that has lost all trust in the facility's discharge process."
