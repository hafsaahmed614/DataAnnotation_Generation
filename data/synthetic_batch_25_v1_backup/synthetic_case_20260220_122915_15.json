The primary barrier is a state-mandated requirement for three contractor estimates for a home ramp, a process currently stalled by contractor no-shows and administrative apathy. The PN must de-escalate a hostile family dynamic and bypass institutional 'steering' to secure a safe home discharge before the financial hard stop occurs."
