The Social Worker, suffering from extreme burnout, has become a bureaucratic barrier, refusing to rectify documentation gaps needed for the 'face-to-face' requirement. The Patient Navigator must navigate this political minefield to secure home health conversion before the patient is forced into a private-pay LTC transition. Success hinges on bypassing the SNF's 'Black Hole' delay to build trust with a family that is increasingly hostile toward the facility's lack of transparency."
