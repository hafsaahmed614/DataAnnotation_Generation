The case is further complicated by a hostile daughter who is ready to pull him home without support and a facility pushing for discharge to avoid the 100-day Medicare cliff. The Patient Navigator must now navigate intense institutional politics and a Managed Medicare authorization lag to ensure Silas doesn't lose his 'skilled need' eligibility before the home transition."
