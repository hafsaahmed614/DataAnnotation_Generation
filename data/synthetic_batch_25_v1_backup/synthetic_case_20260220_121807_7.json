The discharge is blocked by a Medicaid CHC Waiver requirement for three contractor estimates for a wheelchair ramp, a process moving at a glacial pace due to lack of facility cooperation. The PN must navigate a hostile family dynamic and a facility eager to flip the bed to private pay while ensuring the patient doesn't lose her 'skilled need' status before the ramp is installed."
