The facility Social Worker is actively pushing for discharge due to a 'Loss of Skilled Need' after PT/OT signed off, despite the wound remaining open and requiring advanced debridement. The PN must navigate a hostile family dynamic and institutional pressure to find a legitimate clinical skilled need to ensure the patient does not lose access to essential home-based wound care services."
