The situation is exacerbated by a burned-out Social Worker who has checked out of the coordination process and a hostile daughter who fears her mother is being 'dumped' while still clinically fragile. The PN must navigate these institutional politics to secure a safe transition to home health before the 100-day benefit expires, ensuring the wound care conversion is not lost to the facility's administrative chaos."
