The case is further complicated by a burned-out Social Worker who is gatekeeping clinical updates and a facility administration pushing for a Day 21 discharge to protect their financial margins. The PN must navigate these institutional politics to ensure the daughter's financial anxiety doesn't lead to a premature and unsafe discharge home."
