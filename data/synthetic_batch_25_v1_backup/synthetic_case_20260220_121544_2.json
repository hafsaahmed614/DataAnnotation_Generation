  "narrative_summary": "Mrs. Eleanor Vance is a 65-year-old female recovering from an ischemic stroke with a Stage III sacral ulcer, caught between a burned-out Social Worker and a facility protecting its 100-day Medicare financial cliff. The discharge is physically blocked by a two-story home layout requiring a Medicaid CHC Waiver for a stairlift, a process currently stalled by administrative neglect. The case is further complicated by a hostile family dynamic and the facility's aggressive push to flip the patient to Long-Term Care to avoid reimbursement drops. The PN must navigate these institutional politics to secure home-health conversion while maintaining a fragile relationship with a 'quiet quitting' facility staff."
