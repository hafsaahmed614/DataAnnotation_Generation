A 14-day 'Black Hole' delay in PN assignment allowed a burned-out Social Worker to lose control of the discharge plan, while the only local Pulmonologist's illness stalled mandatory Managed Medicare face-to-face O2 documentation. The PN must navigate a hostile facility environment to secure a bridge of care before the hard financial stop on Day 100 forces a transition to private pay."
