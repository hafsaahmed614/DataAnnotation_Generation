The discharge to home is blocked by a Medicaid CHC Waiver requirement for three ramp estimates, which the facility is neglecting in hopes of a lucrative LTC conversion. The PN must navigate a hostile family dynamic and bureaucratic stagnation to source the necessary estimates and align a home oxygen setup before the hard stop of Day 101 forces a permanent institutionalization."
