The primary barrier is a missing 'face-to-face' encounter note required for Managed Medicare Authorization, which the facility staff is too overwhelmed or indifferent to rectify. The PN must navigate a hostile family dynamic and institutional gatekeeping to secure the necessary signatures before the financial 'hard stop' triggers an unsafe discharge or a transition to long-term care."
