  "narrative_summary": "Mrs. Vance, a 77-year-old in renal transition, is caught in a high-stakes tug-of-war between a facility racing to avoid a Medicare co-pay cliff and a family paralyzed by a new dialysis reality. The burned-out Social Worker has effectively 'black-holed' the transition process, leaving a critical gap in insurance authorization for specialized home care. The PN must navigate hostile family dynamics and institutional ghosting to bridge the 3-7 day Managed Medicare authorization delay. Ultimately, the case hinges on whether the PN can secure a clinical 'face-to-face' before the facility forces a discharge that would render the patient ineligible for skilled home services."
