The PN must navigate a missing 'Face-to-Face' encounter signature required by UnitedHealthcare, which threatens to delay discharge by over a week. Success hinges on bypassing the administrative friction via clinical-side alliances (PT and MD) to secure the authorization before the family's frustration leads to a dangerous AMA exit."
