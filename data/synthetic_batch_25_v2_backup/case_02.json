The facility is aggressively managing its 100-day Medicare cliff, attempting to transition Eleanor to private pay or Medicaid LTC by Day 101. The PN must navigate a hostile family dynamic and bureaucratic delays in CHC Waiver approvals while clinically proving Eleanor\u2019s eligibility for home health. Success hinges on bypassing administrative gatekeepers to secure the precise documentation needed to overturn the Managed Medicare denial."
