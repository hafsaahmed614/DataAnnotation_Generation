As his Managed Medicare Advantage plan pends authorization for home health, the facility is aggressively pushing for a Day 100 discharge to protect its financial margins. The PN must navigate a hostile family dynamic and institutional gatekeeping to secure the necessary physician signatures and insurance approvals before the 100-day cliff forces a transition to costly private-pay long-term care."
