The primary friction is a burned-out Social Worker who has stalled the 'Face-to-Face' documentation required for home health transition. The PN must navigate institutional politics to secure surgeon signatures and manage a hostile family dynamic that threatens an unsafe AMA discharge. The case hinges on the PN's ability to drive the transition timeline without triggering a bureaucratic backlash from the facility's administrative staff."
