The primary barrier is a missing 'Face-to-Face' signature required by his Managed Medicare Advantage plan, which is further complicated by the facility's push to avoid the 100-day financial cliff. The Navigator must navigate institutional politics and family anxiety to secure the transition to home health before the patient is forced into a Long-Term Care Medicaid pivot."
