  "narrative_summary": "An 83-year-old female recovering from post-ICU pneumonia was clinically cleared for discharge, but the transition was blocked by a caregiver training gap and DME delays. The Patient Navigator stepped in to bridge the communication gap between a short-staffed SNF and the receiving Home Health Agency. By negotiating a specialized 'education-first' admission with the HHA, the PN ensured the patient could return home safely despite the daughter's initial anxiety with respiratory equipment. The case successfully concluded with the first HHA visit occurring within 24 hours of discharge, securing the patient's recovery trajectory."
