  "narrative_summary": "The transition for this 82-year-old patient was complicated by a significant network mismatch between his Medicare Advantage plan and the specialized Parkinson's home health program he required. The Patient Navigator focused on bridging the communication gap between the HHA's business office and the family to ensure the Single-Case Agreement was prioritized. Following the resolution of the network issue, the PN successfully identified a medication list discrepancy that would have delayed the first home visit. By flagging this for the HHA Clinical Manager, the PN ensured that the transition to home care was safe and that the specialized therapy services were secured."
