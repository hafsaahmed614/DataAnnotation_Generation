  "narrative_summary": "A 74-year-old female recovering from chemotherapy was delayed in her transition to home health due to a caregiver training gap regarding her enteral nutrition pump. While the patient was clinically stable, the HHA could not accept the referral until her son demonstrated competency, a process hindered by a mismatch between SNF training hours and his work schedule. The Patient Navigator successfully aligned the HHA intake requirements with a specialized after-hours training session at the facility, while simultaneously resolving a DME backorder for the feeding supplies. This ensured the patient could discharge on a Friday with full HHA support, avoiding a weekend gap in specialized care."
