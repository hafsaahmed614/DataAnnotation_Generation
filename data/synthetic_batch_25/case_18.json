  "narrative_summary": "An 86-year-old male with dementia and a high fall risk was prepared for transition from a skilled nursing facility to home health care. The transition was threatened when the primary HHA's intake coordinator went on leave, stalling the admission process and risking a dangerous weekend gap in services. The Patient Navigator intervened by bypassing the administrative bottleneck, coordinating directly with the HHA's clinical leadership to ensure a Saturday nurse visit. This proactive coordination secured the home health conversion and ensured the patient had professional oversight immediately following his return home."
