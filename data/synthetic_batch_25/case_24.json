  "narrative_summary": "A 69-year-old female with a diabetic foot ulcer was scheduled for discharge on the Wednesday preceding Thanksgiving, but the transition was threatened by a holiday coverage gap at the preferred HHA. The Patient Navigator stepped in to identify an alternative agency with on-call holiday staff to ensure the wound vac was monitored post-discharge. Additionally, the PN coordinated family training to bridge the 48-hour window between the facility exit and the first HHA visit. This intervention prevented a discharge delay and ensured the patient did not experience a clinical decline over the long holiday weekend."
