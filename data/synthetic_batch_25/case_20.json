The Patient Navigator stepped in to resolve the logistical gridlock by identifying an alternative in-network agency with the necessary wound-care expertise and nursing staff in her zip code. By coordinating the delivery of bridge supplies and confirming medical transport timing, the PN ensured that the HHA was ready for a Monday start-of-care, successfully avoiding a weekend service gap. The transition was finalized once the family felt comfortable with the new agency's credentials, resulting in a successful service conversion."
