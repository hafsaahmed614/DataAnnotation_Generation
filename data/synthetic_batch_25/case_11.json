  "narrative_summary": "The transition for this 70-year-old spinal fusion patient was initially stalled by a severe HHA staffing shortage in his rural zip code, threatening to keep him in the SNF past his clinical readiness. By leveraging relationships with regional HHA directors, the Patient Navigator was able to secure a staffing exception and coordinate a Saturday start-of-care to avoid a weekend gap. This proactive coordination ensured that the patient\u2019s home PT and nursing services were locked in before the facility could pivot to a different discharge plan. The case concluded with a successful home transition, maintaining clinical continuity despite the regional provider shortage."
