Despite the facility proceeding with the discharge on a Friday, the missing paperwork triggered a weekend admission freeze at the agency. The Patient Navigator focused on reconciling the communication breakdown between the facility ward clerk and the HHA branch office to secure a Monday start-of-care. By managing family expectations and verifying home readiness, the PN ensured the patient remained stable at home until professional services could be initiated."
