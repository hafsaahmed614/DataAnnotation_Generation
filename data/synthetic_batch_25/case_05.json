  "narrative_summary": "The transition for this 83-year-old patient was primarily delayed by the rigid 'three-estimate' requirement of the Medicaid CHC Waiver for a necessary front-door ramp. While the facility managed the clinical recovery from pneumonia, the Patient Navigator worked to bridge the 40-day environmental gap by ensuring the Home Health Agency (HHA) remained engaged and prepared for a complex respiratory handoff. The PN successfully navigated a staffing shortage in a rural zip code and reconciled a medication mismatch regarding nebulizer treatments before the patient arrived home. By facilitating a pre-discharge equipment training session for the daughter, the PN secured a successful service conversion despite the lengthy bureaucratic stall."
