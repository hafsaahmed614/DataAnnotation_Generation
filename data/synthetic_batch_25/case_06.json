The HHA is unwilling to commit to a Start-of-Care visit until the discrepancies regarding her nebulizer and antibiotic taper are resolved, threatening a weekend coverage gap. The Patient Navigator intervenes by facilitating the transfer of the correct reconciliation paperwork from the SNF to the HHA intake desk. This coordination ensures the patient returns home with a confirmed nurse visit scheduled within 24 hours, maintaining clinical safety and preventing a hospital readmission."
