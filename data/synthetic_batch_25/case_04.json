  "narrative_summary": "A 68-year-old female recovering from an MS flare is nearing discharge but faces a significant logistical hurdle due to a regional backlog in DME deliveries for required home mobility equipment. The Patient Navigator stepped in to bridge the gap between the facility's discharge timing and the Home Health Agency's (HHA) admission requirements, focusing on equipment verification and family readiness. By navigating vendor availability and clarifying the HHA's first-visit schedule, the PN ensures the patient transitions home with the necessary support to prevent a relapse or hospital readmission. The case highlights the critical role of the PN in managing the 'last mile' of the home health transition when administrative and logistical frictions threaten the continuity of care."
