The Patient Navigator focused on maintaining the HHA's commitment to the case despite the extended timeline and rural staffing shortages. By reconciling a medication list mismatch and preventing a Friday discharge during an HHA weekend freeze, the PN ensured the patient returned home with both the physical modifications and skilled nursing support synchronized for a safe recovery."
