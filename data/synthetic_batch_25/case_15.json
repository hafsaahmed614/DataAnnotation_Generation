  "narrative_summary": "Mr. Arthur Vance, an 81-year-old stroke survivor, is caught between a Managed Medicare authorization delay and a facility eager to transition him to private-pay LTC as his 100-day benefit cliff approaches. The institutional friction is compounded by a burned-out Social Worker who is providing minimal effort in securing the mandatory 'face-to-face' physician signatures. The Patient Navigator must navigate these political waters to ensure a timely home discharge before the facility's financial interests lock the patient into long-term care. The case tests the veteran's ability to bypass administrative bottlenecks without triggering professional retaliation from facility leadership."
