While the patient achieved his clinical milestones for discharge, the lack of an in-network HHA with available Physical Therapy staff created a ten-day 'Timeline Drift'. The Patient Navigator successfully identified an alternative in-network agency and coordinated with the facility Social Worker to ensure a warm handoff. This intervention prevented a complete service refusal by the family and secured a confirmed start-of-care date that aligned with the patient's home arrival."
