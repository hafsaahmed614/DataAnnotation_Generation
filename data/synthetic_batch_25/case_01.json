The facility's Social Worker is non-responsive due to impending retirement, and a Managed Medicare Advantage plan has stalled the authorization process by demanding specific gait-training documentation. The case is further complicated by a hostile family concerned about the 100-day Medicare cliff, requiring the Navigator to bypass institutional inertia to secure a safe and paid home transition."
