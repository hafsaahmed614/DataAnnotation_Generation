While the facility handled the clinical discharge, the Patient Navigator intervened to bridge the gap between the HHA's rigid scheduling and the family's availability for home modifications. By reconciling a medication list mismatch and identifying an alternative agency when the primary HHA faced staffing shortages, the PN ensured the patient did not experience a care gap over a holiday weekend. The transition ultimately succeeded once the home was verified as safe for walker use, allowing the first HHA nursing visit to occur within 24 hours of discharge."
