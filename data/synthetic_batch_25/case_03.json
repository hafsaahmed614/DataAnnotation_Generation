The facility's Social Worker is exhibiting severe burnout, refusing to assist with physician outreach, while the patient's daughter is threatening a legal grievance over perceived safety concerns. As the 100-day Medicare cliff looms, the PN must navigate institutional politics and administrative delays to secure the F2F documentation before the facility forces an LTC transition. The case tests the PN's ability to bypass uncooperative staff while managing an anxious family dynamic and strict insurance requirements."
