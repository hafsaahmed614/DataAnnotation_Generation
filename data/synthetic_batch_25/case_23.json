The transition was nearly derailed when the primary transport vendor failed to arrive, risking a 'weekend slide' where home services would not begin until Monday. The Patient Navigator successfully bridged the gap by coordinating a late-evening admission with the Home Health Agency and facilitating alternative transport options through the facility's Social Worker."
