The search for an in-network replacement is further complicated by a localized staffing shortage that threatens to delay her start-of-care. The Patient Navigator's role is critical in identifying alternative agencies with specific renal experience and ensuring the family accepts the new provider. By facilitating the logistical handoff between the facility and the new HHA, the PN ensures Mrs. Gable does not face a gap in her vital medication and fluid monitoring."
