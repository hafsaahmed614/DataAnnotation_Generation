While the clinical team has cleared her for discharge with supplemental oxygen, the transition is stalled by a lack of caregiver alignment and a regional DME shortage for oxygen concentrators. The Patient Navigator's role focuses on bridging this gap by ensuring the Home Health Agency is fully prepared for a high-acuity admission and that the family understands the support structure available post-discharge. Success is defined by securing a confirmed Start-of-Care date and ensuring all home equipment is verified before the patient leaves the facility."
