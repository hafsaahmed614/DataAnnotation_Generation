The Social Worker has leveraged 'HIPAA policy' to block the PN from obtaining the Face-to-Face documentation required for her Managed Medicare home care authorization. To ensure a successful transition, the PN must bypass administrative barriers through direct clinical engagement with the Wound NP and MD before the facility forces a Hard Stop discharge on Day 94."
