  "narrative_summary": "Following a successful spinal fusion, the patient's transition to home health was stalled by a logistical backlog in hospital bed delivery, a critical requirement for post-surgical mobility. The Patient Navigator stepped in to bridge the gap between the DME vendor's delay and the HHA's strict admission requirements, ensuring the referral was not dropped by the agency. By coordinating the delivery timing with the HHA's staffing schedule, the PN secured a Monday morning start-of-care, preventing a weekend without professional oversight. The case highlights the PN's role in managing external vendor friction to maintain continuity of care after the facility's clinical responsibilities end."
