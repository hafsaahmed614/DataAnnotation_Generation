  "narrative_summary": "An 81-year-old male is ready to transition home following a successful sub-acute rehab stay for an ischemic stroke. The transition was nearly derailed when the primary Home Health Agency's intake coordinator went on leave, leaving the referral in an unconfirmed status as the weekend approached. The Patient Navigator successfully navigated this operational friction by coordinating between the family and an alternative HHA that offered weekend starts-of-care, ensuring PT and OT services began within 24 hours of discharge. This intervention prevented a common 'Friday slump' where high-needs patients sit at home without skilled support for several days."
