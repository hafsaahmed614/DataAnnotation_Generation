  "narrative_summary": "Mr. Bennett, a 75-year-old recovering from a cardiac bypass, was clinically cleared for a Friday discharge, but the transition was immediately threatened by a standard HHA weekend admission freeze. The Patient Navigator stepped in to bridge the 72-hour gap by securing a firm Monday morning Start-of-Care and reconciling a medication list mismatch that occurred during the facility handoff. By coordinating directly with the HHA's regional leadership and providing the family with a clear weekend support plan, the PN prevented a 'fear-based' hospital readmission. The case highlights the critical role of the PN in managing post-discharge logistics when facility responsibility ends and home care has yet to begin."
