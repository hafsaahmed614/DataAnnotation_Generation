The Patient Navigator intervenes by identifying alternative agencies with active wound-certified nurses and coordinating with the Regional Director to bridge the coverage gap. During the final handoff, the PN identifies a medication list mismatch regarding the patient's insulin, resolving it through the HHA intake coordinator to ensure a safe first home visit. The case concludes with a successful transition to home care despite the regional provider limitations."
