  "narrative_summary": "The transition for this 86-year-old patient was complicated by a sudden illness of the HHA's primary dementia-care specialist, which threatened to delay the home return by five days. By coordinating a tiered nursing approach\u2014using a generalist for the initial safety assessment\u2014the PN successfully maintained the Friday discharge date. The PN also addressed a critical medication list mismatch by facilitating communication between the facility and the HHA intake team, ensuring the family felt prepared for the first home visit. This case highlights the PN's role in managing agency staffing gaps and documentation flow to prevent the 'timeline drift' that often leads to institutionalization for elderly patients with dementia."
