The Patient Navigator stepped in to coordinate the flow of corrected documentation between the facility Social Worker and the Home Health Agency's intake department. By ensuring the HHA received the necessary specialist overrides, the PN prevented a weekend service gap and secured a successful Start of Care. The transition was finalized once the family was educated on the HHA's arrival schedule, ensuring continuity of the patient's complex oncology regimen at home."
