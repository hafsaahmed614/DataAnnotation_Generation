The facility is aggressively pushing for a Day 100 discharge to protect its financial margins, despite Arthur's inability to safely manage his spinal brace at home. The Patient Navigator must navigate institutional apathy and family hostility to secure the necessary clinical documentation for an appeal before the '100-Day Cliff' forces a transition to private-pay long-term care."
