The transition plan faltered when the contracted wheelchair transport failed to arrive for the Friday afternoon discharge, threatening the Home Health Agency's (HHA) Friday admission window and triggering a weekend service freeze. The Patient Navigator stepped in to synchronize a new Monday morning transport arrival with the HHA's intake schedule, ensuring the family was equipped for weekend wound management while securing the service adoption for the following week."
