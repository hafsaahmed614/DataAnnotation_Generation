  "narrative_summary": "A 79-year-old male recovering from a right lower extremity amputation is clinically ready for home transition but faces a 45-day delay due to the Medicaid CHC Waiver's procurement rules for a wheelchair ramp. The Patient Navigator must bridge the gap between the facility's discharge timing and the HHA's strict admission windows, especially as the case nears a Friday exit. By identifying a medication list mismatch and a potential PT staffing shortage in the patient's rural area, the PN ensures that the transition is not just a physical move, but a secured clinical handoff. The case highlights the critical importance of aligning environmental modifications with HHA safety protocols to prevent a last-minute service refusal."
